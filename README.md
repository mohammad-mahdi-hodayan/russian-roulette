# russian-roulette


This code is written just for fun, but you can try your luck!
When the main file is executed, a random number from 1 to 6 will be generated. If the number is equal to 1, the system root files will be deleted. (It can only be opened in Windows systems) just like Russian Roulette!
have a nice time...
